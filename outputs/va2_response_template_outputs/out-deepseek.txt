We are given a long text from a source URL about a programme for energy efficiency loans in Greece. We need to extract structured information and fill the provided schema.

 Steps:
 1. Identify the programme name.
 2. Description of the programme.
 3. Objective of the programme.
 4. Eligible parties (who can apply).
 5. Eligibility criteria (conditions to apply).
 6. Property requirements (what kind of properties are eligible).
 7. Minimum and maximum funding amount (if provided).
 8. Funding type (loan or grant).
 9. Interest rate (if it's a loan).
 10. Funding coverage (what costs are covered).
 11. Total budget of the programme.
 12. Funding sources (where the money comes from).
 13. Duration of the programme (how long it runs).
 14. Loan duration (if it's a loan, how long to repay).
 15. Completion deadline (when the projects must be completed).
 16. Application start and end dates.
 17. Energy performance targets (what improvements are required).
 18. Eligible interventions (what types of interventions are allowed).
 19. Application process (how to apply).
 20. Managing body (who runs the programme).
 21. Announcement date (when the call was announced).
 22. Contact info (contact details).
 23. Additional details.

 However, note that the provided text is about a specific call for a loan programme. We must extract the information from the text.

 Let's break down the text:

 - The programme is part of the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) 2014-2020, Operational Programme "Energy", Axis 4 "Energy Efficiency in Buildings".
 - It is a loan for energy efficiency improvements in buildings.
 - The eligible parties are legal entities (companies) and public institutions.
 - The property must be in Greece, and the intervention must be in a building that is the property of the applicant.
 - The funding amount is up to €100,000 per project, but the text says "the maximum amount of the loan is €100,000", and the total budget for the call is €100 million.
 - It is a loan with a duration of up to 15 years, and the interest rate is mentioned as being competitive, but the exact rate is not provided (we might leave it blank).
 - The funding covers the cost of the energy efficiency interventions.
 - The application period is from 28 June 2023 to 31 August 2023.
 - The programme is managed by the Hellenic Republic under the Ministry of Environment and Energy, and the managing body is the Hellenic Investment Bank.

 However, note that the text provided is a bit long and we must be careful to extract only the relevant information.

 Let's map the schema:

 programme_name: "Loan for Energy Efficiency in Buildings" (or something similar)

 description: A brief description.

 programme_objective: To support energy efficiency improvements in buildings.

 eligible_parties: ["Legal entities", "Public institutions"]

 eligibility_criteria: 
   - The property must be located in Greece.
   - The intervention must be in a building that is the property of the applicant.
   - The project must be carried out in the period from 28 June 2023 to 31 August 2023.

 property_requirements: 
   - The property must be in Greece.
   - The building must be the property of the applicant.

 minimum_funding_amount: Not explicitly stated, but the loan can be up to €100,000. We don't have a minimum, so maybe leave as empty string.

 maximum_funding_amount: "€100,000"

 funding_type: "loan"

 interest_rate: Not provided, so leave empty.

 funding_coverage: "Cost of energy efficiency interventions"

 total_budget: "€100,000,000" (for the entire call)

 funding_sources: ["National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) 2014-2020", "Operational Programme Energy", "Axis 4"]

 duration: "2014-2020" (but the specific call is for 2023, so maybe the programme duration is 2014-2020, and the specific call duration is the application period)

 loan_duration: "Up to 15 years"

 completion_deadline: Not explicitly stated, but the intervention must be carried out during the application period? Or the project must be completed by a certain date? The text doesn't specify.

 application_start_date: "2023-06-28"

 application_end_date: "2023-08-31"

 energy_performance_targets: Not explicitly stated, but the intervention must lead to energy efficiency improvements. The text doesn't specify exact targets.

 eligible_interventions: ["Energy efficiency improvements in buildings"]

 application_process: The text doesn't describe the process, but it says the application period is from 28 June 2023 to 31 August 2023. We might need to say that applications are submitted during that period.

 managing_body: "Hellenic Investment Bank"

 announcement_date: Not provided.

 contact_info: ["Ministry of Environment and Energy", "Hellenic Investment Bank"]

 additional_details: Any other relevant information.

 However, note that the text says: "The maximum amount of the loan is €100,000", so the maximum funding amount is €100,000.

 But wait, the total budget for the call is €100 million, so the total_budget is for the entire call, not per project.

 Let's fill the schema accordingly.

 Important: The schema requires exact keys and the list fields must be arrays of strings.

 We must return a JSON array with exactly one object.

 Let's write the JSON object.

 Note: Some fields might not be present in the text, so we leave them as empty strings or omit if the schema requires a string and we don't have it.

 Since the schema requires a string for minimum_funding_amount and maximum_funding_amount, we can put empty strings if not available.

 Let's structure:

 {
   "programme_name": "Loan for Energy Efficiency in Buildings",
   "description": "A loan programme to support energy efficiency improvements in buildings in Greece.",
   "programme_objective": "To promote energy efficiency in buildings by providing loans to legal entities and public institutions.",
   "eligible_parties": ["Legal entities", "Public institutions"],
   "eligibility_criteria": ["The property must be located in Greece", "The intervention must be in a building that is the property of the applicant", "The project must be carried out during the application period"],
   "property_requirements": ["The property must be located in Greece", "The building must be the property of the applicant"],
   "minimum_funding_amount": "",
   "maximum_funding_amount": "€100,000",
   "funding_type": "loan",
   "interest_rate": "",
   "funding_coverage": "Cost of energy efficiency interventions",
   "total_budget": "€100,000,000",
   "funding_sources": ["National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) 2014-2020", "Operational Programme Energy", "Axis 4"],
   "duration": "2014-2020",
   "loan_duration": "Up to 15 years",
   "completion_deadline": "",
   "application_start_date": "2023-06-28",
   "application_end_date": "2023-08-31",
   "energy_performance_targets": "",
   "eligible_interventions": ["Energy efficiency improvements in buildings"],
   "application_process": "Applications are submitted during the period from 28 June 2023 to 31 August 2023.",
   "managing_body": "Hellenic Investment Bank",
   "announcement_date": "",
   "contact_info": ["Ministry of Environment and Energy", "Hellenic Investment Bank"],
   "additional_details": "The programme is part of the NSRF 2014-2020, Operational Programme Energy, Axis 4."
 }

 However, note that the text says the maximum amount is €100,000 per project, and the total budget for the call is €100 million. So the total_budget is for the entire call.

 Also, the duration of the programme is the NSRF duration (2014-2020), but the specific call is for 2023.

 We have to be cautious with the dates and amounts.

 Let's adjust:

 - The maximum funding amount per project is €100,000.
 - The total_budget for the entire call is €100,000,000.

 We'll output the JSON accordingly.

 Since the text does not specify the minimum funding amount, we leave it as empty string.

 We don't have the interest rate, so leave it empty.

 The completion_deadline is not specified, so leave empty.

 The energy_performance_targets are not specified, so leave empty.

 The application_process is a bit vague, but we can say that applications are submitted during the given dates.

 We'll now write the JSON.
